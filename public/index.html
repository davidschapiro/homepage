            My name is David! I am a Jewish youth 
            and young-adult educator and Masorti rabbinical student
            at the Frankel-College in Potsdam. My passion lies
            in everything and anything Jewish. I prepare Bney Mitzwahs
            to chant Torah on their big day; I make Hebrew caligraphy art
            and can check Mezuzahs; I regularly chant from the Torah myself
            on Shabbat and Holidays as well as lead prayer services in
            various synagogues around Berlin.
